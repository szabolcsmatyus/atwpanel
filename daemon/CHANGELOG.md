# Changelog
This file is a running track of new features and fixes to each version of the daemon released starting with `v0.2.0`.

## v0.6.13 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* **[Security]** Fixes a bug in the websocket authorization process that could allow a malcious authenticated user
to connect and send commands to a server they do not have permission to access.
* Fixes utilization metrics to send the correct CPU and memory usage calculations for servers. This now matches the
logic used by `docker stats`.
* Files with a colon in their name can be properly decompressed.

### Added
* Installation docker images can now be prefixed with `~` to use a local image. 

### Changed
* General dependency upgrades to reduce the number of audit warnings on installation.

## v0.6.12 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a bug with the packs system that would not properly handle an error response from the panel resulting in the server
getting stuck in a hung installation state.
* Fixes a bug with how packs were downloaded and decompressed that resulted in them properly downloading but an error
cropping up when decompressing their contents.

### Changed
* Install logs are no longer deleted when a server fails it's installation and is removed.

### Added
* Dockerfile for building an official docker image for the daemon. (uses the golang sftp-server)

## v0.6.11 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* [Security] Addresses one remaining issue with the previous security fixes to completely isolate the host system from malicious users.

## v0.6.10 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a path resolution bug introduced in the previous version of the panel that was causing files and folders that did not exist to return the wrong resolved path.

## v0.6.9 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Updated diagnostics script to have a proper fallback domain to handle Hastebin outages.
* **[Security]** Fixes an unauthorized file read outside of server directory vulnerability when working with the built-in filemanager or SFTP server.

## v0.6.8 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Changed
* Bumped internal thresholds for memory management in containers to provide slightly more overhead to avoid OOM issues.
* Added support for disabling the built-in SFTP server to allow for standalone options.

## v0.6.7 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fix a bug that would cause a server to silently get stuck while in preflight if a config file couldn't be parsed. Now
the process will continue forward and just emit a notice into the console.

## v0.6.6 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes an issue with the `mmmagic` dependency not installing correctly when using Nodejs v10.
* Close the server logs correctly when a server is deleted.
* Fixes a bug causing servers to hang in the 'Starting server container' state if there was an error with the container.
12
* Fix a bug in the SFTP system that would cause a request failure if a file didn't return a valid time created/modified.
* Handle an unknown flag sent from Cyberduck when creating a file.

### Changed
* A non-zero response code from an installer script will now mark a server as having failed installation.
* Less confusing error output when the SFTP subsystem encounters an issue. Will now properly log the error rather than
cause a second error that covers up the initial error.

### Added
* Adds initial beta support for defining custom CA stores that the daemon will use when making HTTPS requests. These
can be set by defining an array of file locations using `internals.ca_stores` in the Daemon configuration.

## v0.6.5 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Changed
* A server that stops cleanly (`ExitCode: 0`) will still trigger crash detection by default. In a previous release we
changed this behavior, and while a logical change, it has caused issues with a larger chunk of users than anticipated.
This setting is now configurable at a global level with `internals.clean_exit_is_crash` setting which defaults to `true`.

## v0.6.4 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a bug with command sending that would cause the request to never complete, thus leading the Panel sending
commands over and over in scheduled tasks.

### Changed
* Archives created by the Panel are now named in a more logical manner based on the name of the file that they
were created from.

## v0.6.3 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a broken crash detection system due to a forgotten callback.
* Fixes an error that would occur when a server was rebuilt and the Docker container log path changed on the Daemon.

### Changed
* Changes the way crash handling works to not forcibly restart the server process if it exits cleanly. This means you
can have plugins stop your server and it will not automatically restart on you. Only processes that exit with code `0`
will be left in the stopped state, all other unexpected stops will result in an automatic restart.
* Less confusing server status indicators when being rebuilt, now completely stops before rebuilding.

## v0.6.2 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Changed behavior of Daemon initialization to check for the existance of a server's data directory before initializing
that server. If the data directory cannot be found a warning is thrown and the server is not registered.
* Fixes an error that would cause a loaded console to not display any previous logs due to a supressed JSON parse error.
* Re-adds pulling docker images with authentication, this was accidentally removed while debugging some issues.

## v0.6.1 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a bug that prevented sending commands to a running server instance. This was due to a regression in the command
handling logic. (aka, too much delete).

## v0.6.0 (Elasticized Elanodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a bug with XML parsing that would cause Nodejs to be unhappy when reading and writing files.
* Fixes a race condition in the route handling that would cause errors to be thrown on busy daemons.
* Daemon no longer fails to boot if it is unable to pull a remote Docker image assuming one already exists on the host system.

### Changed
* Changes the way that server output is handled to allow easier viewing of startup errors early in the process.

### Added
* Better support for RHEL when booting the daemon.
* Support for sending more specific stop signals to running processes. Prefix with `^` followed by the signal name, for example: `^SIGHUP` or `^SIGKILL`.

## v0.5.6 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes SFTP server to play nicely with FileZilla and not respond with 4 of the same file.
* Fixes a bug when doing multiple replacements on a single line for configurations.

## v0.5.5 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes diagnostics script to not die when reading large files and also includes the container name in output for easier linking to a server.
* Fix a potential exception loop when attempting to rebuild a container that does not exist to begin with.
* Server output is now correct and not split across lines.

### Changed
* Cleans up docker container removal and makes debugging messages clearer.
* Reason for process crash (OOM, ErrorText, and ErrorCode) are now output into the logs and the console output for processes.
* Server output throttling is handled differently now and should no longer kill processes that are simply outputting long amounts of data. DoS attacks are recognized and killed in under 1 second, rather than the 30 seconds of previous versions. `internals.throttle.bytes` was removed and replaced with `internals.throttle.lines` with a default value of `1000`.

## v0.5.4 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes a potential docker issue from float64 values being passed in rather than int64.
* Fixes a bug where the daemon would not correctly identify a server's docker container, now uses the UUID to find the container.
* Fix permissions checking when getting base information about a server to allow subusers to view status in panel.

### Changed
* Errors returned by the panel when checking a daemon access token are now logged properly.

## v0.5.3 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes bad function call in `xml-headless` egg parser.
* Fixes issue with Filezilla SFTP client on uploads > 1GB preventing them from being resumed correctly.

### Changed
* Sending a command when the server is offline now returns a HTTP/412 error.

## v0.5.2 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes missing environment variable in installation script for eggs.

### Added
* Added a `internals.throttle.enabled` flag to the config to allow disabling the throttle entirely if needed.

### Changed
* Bumped the default throttle limit to 30Kb every 100ms to hopefully prevent any issues with normal output.

## v0.5.1 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes command used to create a user on the Daemon to work with all supported OSes.
* Fixes output throttling behavior to not lock up the daemon and adjusts limits to `40 KB` of data per second before data is tossed.

### Added
* Servers that trigger a data volume warning more than 5 times in the span of 25 seconds (with 10 second decay per warning) will be killed. This type of event should only occur when a server is flooding output to the console.

### Changed
* Disk usage is now checked every 30 seconds by default to reduce the load on a server.

## v0.5.0 (Dazzling Daohugoupterus)
### Fixed
* Fixes an edge case scenario where a server's data directory might not exist when a container is created.

* File parsing now supports `env.VARIABLE` syntax as a shorter alternative to `server.build.env.VARIABLE` for egg configurations.
* Adds support for inter-server private networking via Docker.
* Added more data integrity checks when running a server. These changes make it impossible to boot a server that has an invalid service option configuration.
* SFTP is now handled internally within the Daemon rather than relying on a Docker SFTP container. Authentication is performed using a Panel user.

### Changed

* Should fix a bug causing servers to not be created correctly on first daemon boot due to a missing SFTP docker container.

### Added
* Adds support for deleting multiple files at once via the API. This currently is not used by anything, but paves a path for a future panel update.
* Adds support for `yarn` package installer, but does not require this installation method.
* Added more verbose error logging when there is an issue connecting to the panel to help with debugging issues.
* Added support for Nodejs `v8`

### Changed
* Cleaned up boot order to be more logical and output information in the correct order.
* Added a cleaner error message if docker does not appear to be running rather than a confusing stack trace.
* Updated multiple dependencies to the latest version.

## v0.4.3 (Candid Comodactylus)
### Fixed

* Updated dependencies to latest versions as well as verified support for Nodejs v8.

## v0.4.2 (Candid Comodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixes security hole which set the active socket permissions to the last user to request the socket, potentially allowing users without permissions to access different console options.

## v0.4.1 (Candid Comodactylus)
### Fixed
* Fixed bug causing `undefined startup` when using an invalid service tag, or general loading issues.
* Fixes potential race condition when booting daemon that would lead to services being incomplete when attemting to load all data.
* Fixes installation process hanging when no script is defined for a service option.

### Changed
* Cleaner handling of errors when attemping to create a new server. If an error occurs the daemon will self-clean and remove the broken server.

* Updated dependencies to latest versions.
* Docker containers are now named after the SFTP username to ease finding those servers in the listing.
* Provide cleaner errors when a server is not found on the system. Return `HTTP/404` if server is missing, and `HTTP/400` if the headrs are invalid.
* Use `/daemon` for all calls to the panel, rather than `/remote`.

### Added
* Service configuration files are now retrieved from the panel the daemon is associated with rather than being locally managed. Any changes are automatically pulled on daemon boot.

### Fixed
* Fixes a network configuration issue with `Docker 1.12.4` caused by no assigned IPv6 gateway.

### Changed
* ICC is now **enabled** by default on `pterodactyl0`.

### Added
* Additional network configuration options are available in core.json if needed to customize network name and subnets.
* Added support for pulling images from private registries.


## v0.3.6 (Barefoot Barbosania)
### Fixed
* Fixes runtime bug that broke socket connections on newly created servers until the daemon was restarted. This was most obvious if you created a new server and then started it and reloaded the page. Due to a modification in the build script the server was improperly initialized and requests would get sucked into the wrong portals.

## v0.3.5 (Barefoot Barbosania)
### Fixed
* Fixes some race conditions and random bugs that would occur when attempting to create a server on the system.
* Fixes a flaw in underlying docker/dockerode implementation that would return a `container not found` error if there was an execution error in the container. Changes `err.statusCode` checks to simply read the response message and look for `No such container:` in the message instead.

## v0.3.4 (Barefoot Barbosania)
### Added
* Added configurable docker policies to allow for more lax security settings if needed. The full list of policies can be found [in our documentation](https://daemon.pterodactyl.io/docs/security-policies).
* Added `PATCH /config` route to allow panel to tweak core configuration file.

### Changed
* Changes the way that server creation is handled to allow initialization of the `Server()` class without a docker container existing on the system. *This change
causes the application startup to take longer if containers are missing for servers, as we hold application boot until all containers are created now.*
* Better file upload error handling, stops file upload if maximum size is exceeded rather than uploading to maximum size.

### Fixed
* Fixes a race condition when updating a server that would fail to assign the correct memory limits to a container.
* Fixes an issue where file decompression would be extremely slow on large files, and might never occur.
* Fixes mislabeled TeamSpeak 3 in configuration preventing proper boot sequence.

### Deprecated
* `uploads.maxFileSize` removed in favor of `uploads.size_limit` which accepts a size in MB rather than bytes.

## v0.3.3 (Barefoot Barbosania)
### Added
* Daemon now checks if it is up-to-date when booting.

### Fixed
* Fixes hardcoded path for SFTP containers that was causing a whole host of issues on some systems.
* Fixes previously known issue where decompressing large files through the file manager throws a `EMFILE: too many open files` error.
* Fixes permissions and error response for URLs.

### Changed
* Updates dependencies across the platform.
* Docker containers are now named with the template `<sftp username>:<randomstring:3>` for easier identification when running `docker ps (-a)`.
* Changes to deletion and creation function to run certain aspects in parallel to increase speed by utilizing `Async.auto()`. Most notable in the delete function.
* Compression and Decompression now use native `tar` and `unzip` modules to reduce memory footprint and keep things speedy.
* Chown function now uses native module for speed and reliability purposes.
* Startup function modified to run more processes in parallel where possible to cut down on startup time.

### Deprecated
* Daemon now requires Nodejs `v6` or `v7` to run. Previous versions are no longer supported.
* Daemon no longer supports Windows ecosystems due to changes in chown and compression functions.

## v0.3.2 (Barefoot Barbosania)

### Fixed
* Fixes bug where Bungeecord and Spigot could not make use of certain features due to security restrictions. This release removes the `noexec` flag from the `/tmp` directory.
* Fixes bug where daemon would report an extraneous error when starting a container marked for rebuild.
* Fixes bug in certain file parsers that prevented the proper functioning of the parser.

## v0.3.1 (Barefoot Barbosania)

### Added
* Support for `*` node in  config file search, as well as support for search and replace in config values. _Only applies to `yaml` and `json` parsers._
* Calling base route now returns system information for authenticated admins using the global token.

### Changed
* Services now properly extend the `Core` class so that you only need to add functions and extend `parent()` if something is being done differently.
* Changed `{{ build.<options> }}` replacements in service configurations to use `server.` or `config.` starts to identify values that should be replaced. **This is a breaking change from `0.3.0` ONLY if you are using custom templates.**

### Fixed
* Fixes a fatal error that was thrown when rebooting servers at times even though there was no actual server error.
* Fixes a bug with the docker gateway being assigned with a subnet when it should not.
* Fixes a bug that didn't detected bungeecord server's first startup, preventing the correct allocation binding. _Bungeecord servers **cannot run** on `:25577` without triggering this reboot line, apologies in advance._

## v0.3.0 (Barefoot Barbosania)

🎉🎉

### Added
* Added method to handle assigning a percent extra memory to containers based on the current allocated. Should help with Minecraft servers hitting OOM when java attempts to allocate a bit over the hard limit.
* Support for ARK Servers.
* Switched to using a pure Socket.io stream to handle file uploads from the browser. Faster, and much less buggy.
* Added support for file copying.
* Added support for creating empty folders though the API.

### Changed
* Changed some docker container creation options to prevent fork-bombing as well as prevent additional routes for privilege escalation in containers.
* Changed server startup async pathway to call `onStarting` not `onStart`. `onStart` is now called when server is marked as started.
* Daemon now uses internal Docker API to determine the container interface to use. Better support for non-linux environments.
* Fallback to `minecraftping` method for all Minecraft servers to mitigate some Gamedig issues.
* Dependencies are now hard-coded to prevent potential issues with the panel or version changes breaking features.
* Servers now report core stats when starting and wait for performing query.
* Query failures no longer spam log, and can be configured to kill servers after a set number of
consecutive failures (or just keep on trucking).
* Daemon now defaults to checking for updated docker images unless specifically configured otherwise.
* **The following API Endpoints have been modified**:
  * `GET /server/file/<file path>` -> `GET /server/file/f/<file path>`
  * `POST /server/file/<file path>` -> `POST /server/file/save` with `path`: `/path/to/saveas.txt` and `contents`: `file contents`
  * `DELETE /server/file/<file path>` -> `DELETE /server/file/f/<file path>`
  * `GET /server/download/<token>` -> `GET /server/file/download/<token>`

### Fixed
* Properly call `onStop`, `onStarting`, and `onStart` when server actions occur.
* Files with spaces in their name would break the `path()` function, this has been fixed.
* Timezone was improperly set inside server containers.

### Known Issues
* Decompressing large files through the file manager throws a `EMFILE: too many open files` error.

### Removed
* BinaryJS has been removed due to it being abandoned and buggy.

## v0.3.0-rc.2

### Fixed
* Remove PID limit that broke literally every Minecraft server with an "unrelated" error. Sorry about that...

## v0.3.0-rc.1
**Known Issue**: Decompressing large files through the file manager throws a `EMFILE: too many open files` error.

### Added
* Added method to handle assigning a percent extra memory to containers based on the current allocated. Should help with Minecraft servers hitting OOM when java attempts to allocate a bit over the hard limit.
* Support for ARK Servers.

### Changed
* Changed some docker container creation options to prevent fork-bombing as well as prevent additional routes for privilege escalation in containers.
* Changed server startup async pathway to call `onStarting` not `onStart`. `onStart` is now called when server is marked as started.

### Fixed
* Properly call `onStop`, `onStarting`, and `onStart` when server actions occur.
* Fix decompressing files setting the wrong permissions on extractions.

## v0.3.0-pre.3

### Added
* Switched to using a pure Socket.io stream to handle file uploads from the browser. Faster, and much less buggy.

### Changed
* Daemon now uses internal Docker API to determine the container interface to use. Better support for non-linux environments.
* Fallback to `minecraftping` method for all Minecraft servers to mitigate some Gamedig issues.

### Fixed
* Chown function was checking paths incorrectly which could lead to issues if a safe path is already passed (redundant pathing basically, not a security risk, jut causes a File not Found error).
* Files with spaces in their name would break the `path()` function, this has been fixed.
* Timezone was improperly set inside server containers.

### Removed
* BinaryJS has been removed due to it being abandoned and buggy.

## v0.3.0-pre.2

### Changed
* Dependencies are now hard-coded to prevent potential issues with the panel or version changes breaking features.

### Fixed
* Fixed bug preventing copy, rename, move of arrays of files.
* Fixed chown bug preventing files from being owned by the container running the server.

### Added
* Added support for file copying.
* Added support for creating empty folders though the API.


## v0.3.0-pre.1

### Changed
* Servers now report core stats when starting and wait for performing query.
* Query failures no longer spam log, and can be configured to kill servers after a set number of
consecutive failures (or just keep on trucking).
* Daemon now defaults to checking for updated docker images unless specifically configured otherwise.
* **The following API Endpoints have been modified**:
  * `GET /server/file/<file path>` -> `GET /server/file/f/<file path>`
  * `POST /server/file/<file path>` -> `POST /server/file/save` with `path`: `/path/to/saveas.txt` and `contents`: `file contents`
  * `DELETE /server/file/<file path>` -> `DELETE /server/file/f/<file path>`
  * `GET /server/download/<token>` -> `GET /server/file/download/<token>`

## v0.2.1

### New Features
* Configurable DNS servers in core configuration for docker containers.
* Bungeecord containers no longer spam up the console with ping information.

### Bug Fixes
* If an environment variable is set to null don't even send it to the docker container. Fixes unset variable check bug for Spigot building.
* Fixed startup sequence to actually mark status as starting as well as prevent querying server until completely started.

### Security
* Root filesystem in containers is now entirely read-only. Container applications can only write to `/home/container` and `/tmp`.
* Prevent logging server output through docker logging methods. Fixes a potential DoS attack vector (and also saves space).
* Drops the following capabilities from containers: `setpcap`, `mknod`, `audit_write`, `chown`, `net_raw`, `dac_override`, `fowner`, `fsetid`, `kill`, `setgid`, `setuid`, `net_bind_service`, `sys_chroot`, `setfcap` in addition to default dropped capabilities.
* Containers are now in isolated networks and unable to directly connect to a container's specific IP address. The daemon will automatically create this network interface on boot.

## v0.2.0
Requires `Panel@0.4.0`

### New Features
* Server Suspension, immediately stops running processes and blocks SFTP and API access.
* Automatic SFTP Container deployment when process is stated (previously required you manually add a container)
* Updating a server's memory, swap, block io, or cpu quota no longer requires a container rebuild and will take effect immediately.
* Better handling of preflight files. Allows using four different systems for parsing with find and replace capabilities (file, properties, ini, and yaml).

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes bug that would display improper newlines with console data. Allows control characters and ANSI color codes to travel through.

### General
* Updated ESLinter and with that updated code to reflect new standards for ES6
* Code Cleanup and more use of `lodash` module in place of `typeof` checks
